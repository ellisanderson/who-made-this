        <p>In the Spring of 2019, designer Eddie Opara paid a visit to the graduate graphic design studio at NC State’s College of Design. The visit preceded a guest lecture Opara gave to the entire College on his work at Pentagram, a special one-on-one with the designer extraordinaire. His advice to the graduate students: cultivate your own design language. Know it, develop it, flaunt it, even in spite of “the client” and their design brief. In talking to the graduate students, Opara was careful not to confuse language with style. For the sake of the argument, style is not a sophisticated enough term. Style carries a connotation to a historically limited understanding of what designers actually do — a practice that includes such “banal” activities as “dialogue, research, organisation, [and] management” (Goggin, 2009, p. 55), not just making things look pretty. Language, in contrast, is inclusive of style and encompasses a designer’s deeper drives, directive, inspirations, philosophy and ethical positions they assume when conducting their work. The sentiment behind Opara’s suggestions is part of a larger discourse explored in the writings of Michael Rock (whom Opara worked with at 2x4 for a period of time), postmodern design’s reclamation of the designer’s personal imprint on their work, and even Lazló Moholy-Nagy’s rhetorical stance on the artist’s role in graphic design (Kostelanetz, 1970), to name a few. Crafting one’s design language is crucial to a richer understanding of the self as ‘Designer.’ There are, however, unspoken implications behind Opara’s proposition.

        <p>Opara seems to suggest that by crafting a design language, we are distinguishing ourselves as individuals. Individualism ultimately becomes our chief “selling point” when clients must decide between one designer and another (or hundreds, thousands of others as may be the case).Yet, <span>“designer as author” assumes that the client <em>wants</em> the designer to exhibit authorship.</span> When a designer accrues clout and prominence in their field, they are suited to demand higher compensation, able to pick and choose projects that align with their design ethos, and have the privilege to take larger creative leaps. A firm (or collective as Opara refers to it) like Pentagram, with partners like Michael Bierut and Paula Scher, has a rich and prestigious history (with work to back it up). But designers operate at all levels of eminence. Many work in-house for non-design-specific companies, where their talents are tied to limited budgets, existing standards and the imagination of project stakeholders. <span>The designer’s ability to stretch out and “speak her mind” through her work is balanced against her role in the company and the limitations it puts on her creative freedom.</span></p>

        <p>James Goggin refers to the “false dichotomy of ‘constrained commissioned work’ vs. ‘experimental self-initiated work’” (Goggin, 2009, p. 55), noting that designers have always worked within constraints. Goggin proposes that contemporary designers have found ways of inserting their “selfness” into constrained projects via “invisible elements.” Here the designer operates as ‘producer,’ as Bruce Mau and Ellen Lupton both suggest, by finding “opportunities to seize control of the technological means of production” (Poynor, 2003, p. 146). Additionally, <span>even if a designer does not intentionally embed herself in the work through “invisible elements,” some part of her creative personality may leak through, no matter how much the project constraints suppress her voice.</span> A peer said to me recently that her boss is able to distinguish her work from her colleague’s, even though both designers follow strict brand guidelines. This may be a testament to her boss’s familiar relationship to her work. The public’s reaction to both her and her colleague’s work is funneled through the same brand lens and thus may become homogenized in the eyes of the viewer. <span>Her voice may not survive once the work has left its place of origin.</span></p>

      <div class="columns">
        <p>Opara’s advice seems to imply, at least superficially, that a designer’s language will be recognized and understood by others. Roland Barthes (1968), Michel Foucault (1969) and Louise Rosenblatt (1978) all challenged the premise of the author as originator, instead championing the preeminent power of the reader to impose their own meaning when digesting a work. Postmodernist literary theory dispels the notion that the author can somehow maintain control over her text or exact a particular message. The same applies to design. <span>A designer may have a clear sense of the deeper meaning behind her work when designing for a particular outcome, but this hardly guarantees that her intentions will be received with any kind of fidelity.</span> This is not to say that intention is fruitless, more that interpretation trumps all. Michael Rock writes in his essay The Designer as Author, “the idea of a decentered message does not necessarily sit well in a professional relationship in which the client is paying the designer to convey specific information or emotions” (Armstrong, 2009, p. 110). Perhaps, by assuming a position of authorship (authority), designers are not foregoing objectivity, or staking a claim in the art vs. design debate, so much as they are attempting to reclaim a kind of confidence-building self-assuredness, as if to convince would-be clients (or themselves) that “YES! We can make a difference!” We may be fooling ourselves, knowing full well that the work will ultimately be broken down and absorbed by an unforgiving, intention-altering reader.</p>

        <p>A designer may be able to find ways to embed her thumbprint in the work, but <span>will anyone notice or care once they have decoded the message?</span> Other designers certainly appreciate and attend to the language of other designers. The visibility of a designer’s vocabulary can be seen in the work of someone like Opara, who has spent decades developing his language, in part to converse with other designers. A designer’s prestige affords them more choices to engage with projects that align with their particular design language, projects that are public facing and not just for the benefit of other designers. This is a bit of a catch-22; a designer needs a voice, an authoritative design language to take part in the conversation, but in order to achieve a degree of authority, the designer must often work her way through situations where her language may not be accepted or even noticed. <span>When does the designer elevate her design language?</span> Perhaps developing a language is, in the end, simply a mental state, a way of approaching the design process, not a philosophical stance on whether design is an authored or authorless endeavor. Developing and advocating for one’s language allows the designer to explore according to personal intuition rather than preemptively limiting the production of ideas in service of a set of corporate constraints. Opara is not a blind optimist; he understands, perhaps better than most, that designers are bound up in the stipulations set by their clients and that their work will ultimately be decoded in any number of ways by the public. But without some skin in the game, some level of authorship, the designer becomes more automaton than contributor.</p>
